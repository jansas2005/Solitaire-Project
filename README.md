## My Contributions (Jan Sas)

As a member of this project, my primary responsibilities included:

* Implementing the core game logic in `main_window.py` (e.g., card movement rules, checking for win/lose conditions).
* Connecting the front-end UI components (buttons, card graphics) with the back-end game mechanics.
* [Dopisz cokolwiek innego, co robiłeś, np. "Debugging user interaction bugs" albo "Managing the Git repository workflow"]
